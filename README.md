# Introduction
The website I have built is for a regional financial news magazine named the London Business Times. The financial magazine has a focus on the UK economy and financial market and a minor focus on European markets. The London Business Times is a subscription-based website where only subscribers can have full access to all articles. Non-subscribers can only see some of the titles, images and some summaries of articles. Apart from digital copy, the London Business Times also offers hard copy, which is a subscription option. 
The structure of the website is based on a tree structure, where the index.html is the root of the directory. However, even though index.html is the main root, all pages are able to access any other page conveniently since the menu is available on all pages. This design is similar to many modern websites today.
