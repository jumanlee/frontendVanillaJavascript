                <p>
                    Retirement is often considered synonymous with freedom, as people aspire to live a stress free life devoid of financial worries and instead can pursue their dreams and hobbies, whether it be taking a Caribbean cruise or taking up golf lessons. While consumers may share the same desire for financial freedom, their preferences on how to use their savings at retirement tend to differ over time and in accordance to their personal attributes and the economic situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is clearly demonstrated by the Pensions Freedom Index (PFI), which looks into the retirement choices of 52,000 individuals who accessed eValue’s Pensions Freedom Planner tool in the two years ending April 2017. The PFI breaks down consumers’ choices into three categories, namely Flexible Income, Guaranteed Income and Cash Lump Sum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general, Flexible Income is easily the most preferred pension option, followed by Guaranteed Income, though the gap between the two narrowed considerably during the course of the reporting period. Under UK tax laws, retirees who cash out as a lump sum pay no tax on the first 25% of the amount, while the rest is taxed like salaried income. Hence, it is not difficult to see why Cash Lump Sum remains hugely unpopular, attracting less than 25% of individuals throughout the same timeframe.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The performance of the FTSE 100 is one of the factors shown to have significant influence over pension choices. Consumers tend to favour more flexibility and are more likely to shun guaranteed payouts when the UK stock market is doing well, and vice versa. Both genders are found to exhibit this behaviour, however it is particularly pronounced in men. Another major factor is pension fund size. The PFI indicates that the larger the fund size, the more likely it is that individuals will opt for Flexible Income. It also shows a consistent negative correlation between fund size and consumers’ preference for guaranteed and lump sum payments. The difference across each group is rather noticeable; for instance, Flexible Income only appeals to 40% of individuals with the smallest fund size (up to GBP 50,000), compared to two thirds of those with the largest (valued at GBP 150,000 or more). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Age also plays an important role. Almost half of millennials opt for Guaranteed Income, while only 34% of the Generation X cohort and 28% of baby boomers pursue this option. The PFI also appears to suggest that the closer individuals are to retirement age, the more likely they are to opt for more flexibility. Cash Lump Sum seems to appeal to more or less the same proportion of individuals across the three generations and, as in all the aforementioned cases, is unsurprisingly the least favoured choice.

                    Ultimately, the priority of every retiree is to benefit as much as possible from his or her hard earned nest egg, however this will depend on many factors including not just the financial aspects but also, for example, life expectancy. Without being fully informed, it is difficult to make good retirement decisions based on sound judgment. It is therefore important to plan with sufficient information leveraged from the right sources and tools before one can say with certainty: “Yes, I can afford to retire.”
